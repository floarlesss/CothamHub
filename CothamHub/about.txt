Hello, and thank you so much for giving CothamHub a try!

I developed CothamHub to help you in teaching your students.
CothamHub will constantly grow with your feedback and support.







CothamHub

Developed by Seth Bennett in Year 9. (development started on 21/09/2023 and finished on ---)
CothamHub is meant to be a program with different tools that teachers can use to assist their lesson. Whether it be a timer, reminder tracker or anything else that teachers may suggest be added (or I add).


CothamHub updates by using GitHub.
